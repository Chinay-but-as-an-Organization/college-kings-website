        7 Limitation of liability
      </h1>
      <p className="py-2 text-gray-200">
        <strong>7.1</strong> Users are held personally liable for any violation
        of a third party's rights. Users agree to reimburse Crimsonsky LTD for
        all damages resulting from the culpable non-observance of the
        obligations of these terms and conditions. Users release Crimsonsky LTD
        from all eligible claims that other users or third parties may file
        against Crimsonsky LTD due to a violation of their rights by content
        posted by the user or due to a violation of other obligations. Users

        <strong>7.2</strong> The liability of Crimsonsky LTD, on whatever legal
        grounds, whether due to contractual misconduct or a breach of duty, is

        <strong>7.2.1</strong> If Crimsonsky LTD provides the respective

        for malice and gross negligence.

        <strong>7.2.2</strong> In the case of non-gratuitous services,
        Crimsonsky LTD' liability is limited to cases of malice and gross
        negligence, but unlimited in cases of personal injury. In cases of
        slight negligence, however, Crimsonsky LTD will only be liable for a
        breach of essential contractual obligations such as delay or
        unavailability which Crimsonsky LTD is held responsible for. In the case
        of a breach of an essential contractual obligation, liability is limited
        to the typical contractual damages that Crimsonsky LTD had to calculate
        upon conclusion of the contract due to the circumstances prevailing at
        this time. "Essential contractual obligations", as previously stated,
        are the obligations that may be relied upon by the user and that ensure
        that the contract runs in accordance with its regulations and achieves
        the contractual aim.

        <strong>7.2.5</strong> The aforementioned liability limitations do not
        apply in cases of explicit guarantees made by Crimsonsky LTD, in cases
        of malice, and for damages due to the loss of life, limb, or health.
        Liability shall remain unaffected under the Product Liability Act.
